U1 (`ui/u1-scaffold`) adds `web/`:
- `web/public/fixtures/` is a plain copy of `docs/api/fixtures/` (the one-time U1 copy). It's yours from now on.
- Until I1 adds `web/lib/api/types.ts`, the UI imports temporary types from `web/lib/api/types.tmp.ts` (written from `contract.md`). Once types.ts lands, I'll switch the imports and delete the tmp file in my next step. Feel free to start from it.
- `npm test` (vitest, `lib/**/*.test.ts`) is set up for the web fixture/type test in I1.
- `npm run design:check` fails when `web/app/theme.css` or `web/lib/design/sprites.json` drift from `docs/design/`. Worth adding to CI in I2.
- No `rewrites` in `next.config.ts` yet: that's I4.
Reply (integration): `design:check` runs in CI since I2, before `build`. The fixture copy and `types.tmp.ts` are covered by I1 (#13).

B1 (PR `backend/b1-activity`): `V4__activity.sql` adds `daily_contributions`; new `repository/DailyContributionsRepository` (JdbcTemplate upsert) and `sync/ActivityWriter`, for the AGENTS.md index. For I2: once Testcontainers lands, an `it/` test that runs the upsert twice (no duplicates, `branch_commit_count` kept) would cover what the unit tests can't. Open question for B3: which timezone GitHub buckets calendar days in; B1 stores the dates as returned.
Reply (integration): the upsert IT is in I2 (`it/DailyContributionsRepositoryIT`). It found B36, see the REQUEST below.

B2 (`backend/b2-errors`): every error is now `application/problem+json` `{type: "about:blank", title, status, detail, instance: <path>}`. Full per-status list sent to the integration session. Two things for the contract:
1. Proposed: validation 400s add `errors: [{field, message}]`, with `field` the snake_case JSON key. First used by B5's `PUT /preferences`.
2. `X-RateLimit-*` headers are only on the interceptor's endpoints (login, callback, insights), not on `POST /sync`'s cooldown/busy 429s. Both have `Retry-After`.
3. `AGENTS.md` (your lane): the bug count is now B1–B35, and there's a new `error/` package (`ApiExceptionHandler`, `ProblemDetails`, `ProblemErrorController`, `TooManyRequestsException`).
Reply (integration): 1 approved and 2 documented in `contract.md` "Conventions → Errors" (I1, #13). 3 follows in I2, now that #12 is merged.
Status: done (3 in I2)

I1 (`int/i1-types`) adds `web/lib/api/types.ts`. Its exports are the same as `types.tmp.ts`, plus runtime enum arrays (`MOODS`, `TIERS`, `WEEK_STATUSES`, `HERO_EVENT_TYPES`, `BASE_MOODS`) and `FieldError` / `ValidationProblem` for validation 400s. Once it merges, switch the imports and delete `types.tmp.ts` (your U1 plan).
- Contract changes (B2 errors): `type` is always `about:blank`, so branch on status + endpoint; 500 is treated like 502; `/sync` 429s have no `X-RateLimit-*`; validation 400s carry `errors[]`.
- Week strip rule: today's cell is `today`, or `rest` on a rest day. Highlight today by `today.date`, not by status.
- Fixture change: the `sleeping` variant now carries its own `week` (Sunday 18 Oct, Fri and Sat active, streak 3, 3 hearts, base mood HAPPY). Before, it kept Friday's week, so Friday still showed as today.
- `npm test` now includes `lib/api/fixtures.test.ts` (fixture drift + validation against the types).
Reply (integration): the UI did this in U3 (#18): imports switched to `types.ts`, `types.tmp.ts` deleted, today highlighted by `today.date`.

Re B1: the `it/` upsert test (run twice, no duplicates, `branch_commit_count` kept) is noted for I2. Re B2's AGENTS.md request (the `error/` package in the index, bugs B1–B35): done in I2, now that #12 is merged.

**B36 (BUGS.md), urgent: every sync fails at the activity write.** `DailyContributionsRepository` uses unqualified `daily_contributions`. Only JPA has `default_schema: v2`, and nothing sets `search_path` for plain JDBC, so on a real Postgres the upsert and `latestDate` fail with `relation "daily_contributions" does not exist`. `SyncService.sync` doesn't catch it, so `POST /sync` → 500 and the login sync fails.
- Proof: `it/DailyContributionsRepositoryIT` (I2) on Testcontainers Postgres 17. With `spring.datasource.hikari.connection-init-sql=SET search_path TO v2`, all 3 tests pass, so the upsert logic itself is right.
- Fix, your call: qualify the SQL (`v2.daily_contributions`), or set the schema on every pooled connection (`connection-init-sql`, or `spring.datasource.hikari.schema: v2`). Not `currentSchema` in the JDBC URL: `@ServiceConnection` replaces the URL in tests, so the ITs would still fail.
- Then delete the `@Disabled("B36 …")` line in `it/DailyContributionsRepositoryIT` (that one-line change in my lane is fine in your PR) and run `./mvnw verify` (Docker needed). Do this before B3, which writes `branch_commit_count` with the same kind of SQL.
Reply (integration): fixed in #16 (the table is qualified with the Flyway schema) and #17 (`@Disabled` removed). All ITs run in CI.

Design kit (`docs/design/sprites.json`, `variants.sleepingEyesRow`): only MONK has a closed-eyes row. U3 (#18) uses it for SLEEPING. The other 7 classes sleep with open eyes plus "Z z" until rows exist. Please add a closed-eyes row for PALADIN, BARBARIAN, WIZARD, ARTIFICER, CLERIC, BARD and ROGUE (row index can differ per class: say which row each replaces, or make the value `{row, grid}`). The UI picks them up through `npm run design` with no code change if the shape stays `{CLASS: "row"}` for row 4.
Reply (integration): #19 adds `variants.sleepingEyes` (`{CLASS: {row, value}}`), because the eyes sit on a different row per class: BARBARIAN 3, WIZARD 6, ARTIFICER 6, CLERIC 6, BARD 5, MONK 4, ROGUE 5. PALADIN has none (the visor hides the eyes). The UI switched in #18; the deprecated `sleepingEyesRow` is removed in the integration PR after B3.

B3 (`backend/b3-daily-sync`): daily sync + branch scan. Three things, all in your lane:
1. `PROGRESS.md`, Phase 10 "as built", the two answers WORKFLOW asks for:
   - **`history(since, until)` filters on committer date** (verified live, `BranchActivityLiveTest`: a spring-boot commit authored 2026-04-30 and committed 2026-10-14 is found only in a window around 14 Oct). So a rebase moves the user's commits to the rebase day, and rebasing your own old commits makes today active. The `author: {id}` filter still means only the user's own commits count.
   - **Calendar days are GitHub's per-contribution buckets, not UTC.** A commit counts on the day of its own timestamp's timezone (usually the user's), and PRs and issues opened on the web count on the day in the browser's timezone ([docs](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/concepts/contributions-on-your-profile), [2014 change](https://github.blog/news-insights/timezone-aware-contribution-graphs)). So the calendar's dates are taken as the user's local dates, unconverted. The branch scan uses explicit local-midnight windows (`DayWindow`), UTC until B4 adds `users.timezone`.
   - Also for the log: the scan costs 1 point per call, and it runs only for days the calendar shows as 0 (today and yesterday, `branch-scan-days: 2`). `branch_commit_count` never goes down (`GREATEST`), so commits stay counted after their branch is deleted. The daily sync runs at 03:00 UTC (`insightshub.sync.cron`), 4 users at a time (`concurrency`). It claims the per-user cooldown and doesn't use the `sync-global` cap.
2. `AGENTS.md` index: in `sync/`, add `ScheduledSync` (`@Scheduled` daily sync, virtual threads + semaphore, per-user isolation), `BranchScanner`, `DayWindow`. In `github/`, add `countBranchCommits` + `graphql/branch-activity.graphql` and `model/BranchActivityData`; `GitHubUser` now has `id` (node id). In `config/`, add `SchedulingConfig`. In tests, add `BranchActivityLiveTest` (opt-in, `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
3. `it/` (your lane, written in the PR at your request): new tests in `DailyContributionsRepositoryIT` (the branch upsert: inserts a new day, never lowers, leaves `calendar_count` alone) and `UsersRepositoryIT` (`findIdsForScheduledSync` skips users with no token or `needs_reauth`).
No API contract changes.
Reply (integration): 1 in `PROGRESS.md` Phase 10 "As built" plus the learning log; 2 in the `AGENTS.md` index; 3 approved, listed in `AGENTS.md`. The ITs also turn the cron off now (`TestcontainersConfig`, `insightshub.sync.cron: "-"`).

B4 (`backend/b4-hero`): `V5__hero.sql` + `hero/HeroRules`. No API shape changes, but V5 has three additions to the plan's schema, and §2 had three gaps I filled. Please check them before B5 and add the event details to `contract.md`:
1. **Schema additions** (internal, no response changes):
   - `hero_days(user_id, on_date, xp_gained, streak)`, one row per settled day. `GET /hero/events` returns `xp_days[{on_date, xp, streak}]`, and `hero_events` can't rebuild XP and streak.
   - `users.rest_days_previous` + `users.rest_days_from`. "A change applies from the next local day" needs the old mask when the job catches up on days before the change (`RestDays.maskOn`).
   - Rest-day mask: bit 0 = Monday … bit 6 = Sunday. The CHECK allows at most 2 bits set and values below 128.
2. **Event `details`** (the fixture shows the first three; the rest are mine):
   - `LIFE_LOST {lives, reason: "NO_ACTIVITY"}`. On the last heart, `lives` is 0 and a `LEVEL_DOWN` or `FAINTED` follows on the same date.
   - `LIFE_GAINED {lives, streak}`, `LEVEL_UP {from, to}`, `LEVEL_DOWN {from, to}`.
   - `FAINTED {}`, `RESTED {}`.
   - On a day with both, the order is `LEVEL_UP` then `LIFE_GAINED`.
3. **Rule gaps I filled** (for PROGRESS.md; the developer may want to confirm):
   - **Sign-up day:** "only days after sign-up can cost hearts", so an inactive sign-up day has no effect (no event, streak unchanged), and an active one counts normally.
   - **Seed:** besides the XP (10 per active day in the 90 days up to yesterday, hearts 3, no events), the streak is the run of active days ending yesterday.
   - **Level-down:** XP goes to 0 in the new level ("back to the start of that level"). A faint at level 1 also resets XP to 0 and refills the hearts.
4. **Grace:** `HeroRules.dueDays(lastEvaluatedOn, now, zone)` makes a day due at 06:00 local the next morning (`GRACE` = 6 h). B5's hourly job uses it.
5. `AGENTS.md` index: a new `hero/` package (`HeroRules`, `HeroState`, `HeroDay`, `HeroEvent`, `HeroEventType`, `RestDays`), V5 in Resources, and the tests `HeroRulesTest`, `DueDaysTest`, `RestDaysTest`.
6. `it/` (your lane, added as you offered): `HeroSchemaIT`, V5's CHECKs and keys against the rules. User id 9_000_030, clear of the other ITs' ids.
Reply (integration): 1, 2 and 4 approved. `contract.md` now defines the event `details` and `xp_days` (one row per settled day, 0 XP on missed and rest days), and `hero-events.json` is a 30-day story replayed with these rules. 3 is in `PROGRESS.md` Phase 11 "As built", marked for the developer to confirm. 5 is in the `AGENTS.md` index. 6: thanks. Each IT class now owns a block of 100 ids (`IntegrationTest` javadoc); `HeroSchemaIT` moved to 9_000_201 and `UsersRepositoryIT` to 9_000_101.

B5 (`backend/b5-hero-api`): the hourly hero job, `GET /hero`, `GET /hero/events`, `GET/PUT /preferences`, and the `#token` redirect. The responses match the fixtures as they are (`HeroApiTest` compares `hero.json`, `hero-events.json` and `preferences.json` strictly; `HeroQueryServiceTest` replays the fixture story through the real derivation and gets exactly `hero.json` and `hero-events.json`). Requests, all in your lane:
1. **`contract.md`, conventions:** `X-RateLimit-*` now also come from the new endpoints, which carry `@RateLimit` like `GET /insights`: `GET /hero` + `GET /hero/events` share `hero` (60/min per user), `GET` + `PUT /preferences` share `preferences` (20/min per user).
2. **`contract.md`, readings I took where it was open (please confirm or correct):**
   - `mood` priority: `FAINTED` > `LEVEL_UP` > `SLEEPING` > `HUNGRY` > base mood. `FAINTED` shows after a `LEVEL_DOWN` too, not only a level-1 faint: the overlay reads "LV n → n−1", and both mean the hearts ran out. The one-off moods come from the events on `last_evaluated_on` and last until the next evaluation.
   - `SLEEPING` only on a rest day with no activity yet; a rest day with activity shows the base mood (or a one-off).
   - `GET /hero/events?days=N`: the window is `today − N … today` in the user's zone (30 → 16 Sep … 16 Oct in the fixture). 404 before the first sync, like `/hero`. `days` outside 1–90 → validation 400 with `errors[{field: "days"}]`; a non-number → Spring's own 400.
   - `PUT /preferences` takes the full object: all four fields are required (`errors[]` per missing field). Messages: `timezone` "must be an IANA time zone, like Europe/Berlin" (region ids only: `+05:30` and `GMT+5` are refused), `rest_days` "at most 2 rest days" and "must not repeat a day". An unknown weekday string is a JSON error, so Spring's own 400 without `errors`. 404 if the JWT's user no longer exists.
   - The week strip shows days before sign-up as `missed` (there's no "none" status). Probably fine for the first week only.
3. **`PROGRESS.md`, Phase 11 "As built" (B5):**
   - `hero/HeroJob`: `@Scheduled(cron = "${insightshub.hero.cron}", zone = "UTC")`, default `0 5 * * * *`. `HeroService.dueHeroes()` pre-filters in SQL (`last_evaluated_on` before the latest day due anywhere, UTC+18), then `HeroRules.dueDays` per zone. Per due user, on a virtual thread (at most `insightshub.hero.concurrency`, 4): `SyncService.refreshActivity` (see B37), then `HeroService.evaluate`, which settles every due day in one transaction (`HeroWriter.apply`): compare-and-set on `last_evaluated_on`, then `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for events and `hero_days`. Re-runs and a second instance write nothing twice. Per-user isolation; a summary is logged per run.
   - **Decision for the developer:** a user whose token GitHub rejects (`needs_reauth`) is **not** evaluated: the hero waits instead of losing a heart a day for activity we can't see, and catches up in order after the next login. If GitHub is down, the days wait for the next hourly run.
   - The hero is created at the end of every successful sync (`HeroService.seedIfMissing`, after the insights are saved), so `GET /hero` is 404 exactly until the first sync. A failed seed is logged and retried by the next sync.
   - Days on or before the sign-up day (local) can't cost a heart; "before" can happen when a zone change moves the local dates back. Rest days use `RestDays.maskOn` per settled day. A rest-day change (`PUT /preferences`) stores today's mask as `rest_days_previous` and applies from tomorrow in the new zone.
   - The sync's branch scan now uses `users.timezone` (was UTC until B5).
   - `insightshub.auth.redirect-to-frontend` is now `true` in `application.yml`: the callback 302s to `${FRONTEND_URL}/dashboard#token=<jwt>`. `false` still returns the token as JSON.
   - Follow-up idea: the refresh reuses `user-insights.graphql` with a short window; a calendar-only query would be cheaper.
   - Phase 11 "Done when": "running the hero job twice creates no duplicate events, and a 3-day outage is caught up in order" is covered by `HeroServiceTest` (+ the IT below).
4. **`AGENTS.md` index:** `hero/` adds `HeroJob`, `HeroService`, `HeroWriter`, `HeroView` (pure: mood, tier, week, class block), `HeroProperties` (`insightshub.hero.*`: `cron`, `concurrency`, `qualify-score` 40, `class-cooldown` 7d), enums `Mood`, `Tier`, `WeekStatus`. `repository/` adds `HeroRepository` (JdbcTemplate, schema-qualified) and `DailyContributionsRepository.findCounts`. `user/` adds `HeroController`, `PreferencesController`, `HeroQueryService`, `PreferencesService`, DTOs `HeroResponse`, `HeroEventsResponse`, `Preferences`, constraint `IanaTimeZone`. `entity/Users` maps the V5 columns. `SyncService.refreshActivity`. Tests: `HeroViewTest`, `HeroServiceTest`, `HeroJobTest`, `HeroQueryServiceTest`, `PreferencesServiceTest`, `HeroApiTest`, `HeroRepositoryTest`, `AuthRedirectTest`. Bugs now B1–B37. HTTP surface: the four new endpoints.
5. **`it/`:** one line in `TestcontainersConfig` turns the hero cron off (`insightshub.hero.cron: "-"`), like the sync's. And please add a **`HeroRepositoryIT`** (block 9_000_3xx): I ran one locally against Testcontainers and it passed, but didn't commit it since `it/` is yours. The code is in the PR description: seed, then a 4-day catch-up settled twice (second run writes nothing), the `last_evaluated_on` compare-and-set, `findCandidates`, events in order with JSONB details, and `PreferencesService` persisting to `users`.
6. **For I4:** the callback now redirects with the fragment, so `/dashboard` can read `#token` as planned.
Reply (integration, `int/b5-contract`): 1 and 2 approved, all readings in `contract.md` (rate limits in Conventions; mood priority and pre-sign-up `missed` under `GET /hero`; window, 404 and `days` 400 under `/hero/events`; full object and messages under `/preferences`). 3 in `PROGRESS.md` Phase 11 "As built (B5)", with `needs_reauth` recorded as **confirmed by the developer (2026-10-19)**. 4 in the `AGENTS.md` index. 5: the `TestcontainersConfig` line is fine; `it/HeroRepositoryIT` added (block 9_000_3xx), with exact due-day counts from `HeroRules.dueDays` instead of `>= 2`, and the rest-day hand-over columns checked. 6 noted for I4.

**Go-aheads from the developer (2026-10-19):** backend **B6** (`PUT /hero/class`), ui **U5** (Change class + Settings, continuing from its uncommitted work on `ui/u5-class-settings`), integration `int/b5-contract` then **I3**.
B6 contract, agreed with backend before it started (now in `contract.md`, `PUT /hero/class`):
- Body `{archetype: CLASS|null}`; a missing key = `null`. 200 = the updated `hero`. 409 not qualified, 429 + `Retry-After` cooldown, Spring's own 400 for an unknown class, 404 before the hero exists. Rate limit `hero-class`, 10/min per user.
- No-op (requested == stored `chosen`) checked first: 200, no event, no cooldown change. Every real change starts the cooldown, including → `null` and **pinning** the followed class (`from == to`; the UI says "PIN <CLASS>" / "Pinned <CLASS>").
- `CLASS_CHANGED` details `{from, to, chosen}` (`from`/`to` = `class.current` before/after), on the local today. Typed in `web/lib/api/types.ts` (`HeroEventDetails`); the fixture test now checks every event's `details` per type.
- Racing PUTs: compare-and-set on `archetype_changed_at`; the loser gets 429 with `Retry-After` from the winner's change.
- Fixtures: `CLASS_CHANGED` isn't in `hero-events.json` yet, because `HeroQueryServiceTest` replays that file strictly. If B6 wants one in the story, send a REQUEST and we change the fixture and your test data together.

U5 (`ui/u5-class-settings`): Change class + Settings. Settings uses the real `GET/PUT /preferences` shapes; `PUT /hero/class` stays mocked until B6. For your next PRs:
1. **B6 as I mocked it** (from your messages, please put it in `contract.md`): body `{archetype}` (null or a missing key = follow the top score); picking the stored `chosen` again → 200, no cooldown; any other change (including pinning the followed top class) → 200 + the 7-day cooldown and `CLASS_CHANGED {from, to, chosen}` on today's date; 409 not qualified; 429 + `Retry-After` during the cooldown. A no-op wins over the cooldown check.
2. **Event text:** `CLASS_CHANGED` with `from == to` reads "Pinned Monk.", `chosen: null` reads "Following the top score: Monk.", otherwise "Became a Rogue.". The event log lives in Home's recent events (the Journal has no event list).
3. **Mock routing:** B5 is live, so outside mock mode only `PUT /api/user/hero/class` is served by the mock now. `NEXT_PUBLIC_HERO_API` is gone (`.env.example`, `web/README.md`). Once B6 merges, the entry in `PENDING_ENDPOINTS` (`web/lib/mock.ts`) goes.
4. **For I4:** sending the browser's zone on first login when it differs (contract, preferences) isn't in U5. It fits the `/dashboard` hand-off. Settings compares zones by what `Intl` resolves them to, since Chrome reports `Asia/Calcutta` for `Asia/Kolkata`.
5. A fixture variant with a `CLASS_CHANGED` event would help I5; the mock appends one after a mock change, so it isn't needed for U5.
Reply (integration): 1 and 2 are in `contract.md` (#26), word for word. 3 is noted for I4, 4 for I5 (the `CLASS_CHANGED` fixture variant, once B6 fixes its shape on the backend side too).

I3 (`int/i3-contract-tests`): `it/ApiContractIT` checks the real API by shape against `docs/api/fixtures/` and `contract.md`, going through the whole stack: keys, JSON kinds, nullables, enums, formats, error shapes, rate-limit headers.
- **Backend:** a renamed key, a new field, an int that becomes a decimal, or a new enum value now fails `./mvnw verify` until the contract and fixtures change with it. Send a REQUEST first. For B6: add `CLASS_CHANGED` to the story in `ApiContractIT` (one line in `playStory` once `PUT /hero/class` exists; that file is in my lane, so ask and I'll do it, or include it in your PR as before).

B6 (`backend/b6-hero-class`): `PUT /api/user/hero/class`, built to the contract agreed on 2026-10-19 (your `int/b5-contract`). Requests, all in your lane:
1. **`contract.md`, two details from the build:**
   - When a class is both not qualified and in the cooldown, the answer is **409**, not 429: waiting wouldn't help. Order: same as stored → 200 no-op; not qualified → 409; cooldown → 429; else the change.
   - A PUT that loses the race re-reads the user. If the winner stored the **same** class, the loser gets a 200 no-op (consistent with "requested == stored"); otherwise 429 with `Retry-After` from the winner's fresh `archetype_changed_at`.
   - 409 `detail`: "ROGUE isn't qualified: it scores 33, and a class needs 40 or the top score". 429 `detail`: "The class was changed recently; it can change again at <instant>".
2. **`AGENTS.md` index:** `hero/` adds `ClassSwitch` (pure: `decide` → `Unchanged | NotQualified | CoolingDown | Change`); `HeroWriter.changeClass`. `user/` adds `HeroClassService`, DTO `ClassRequest`; `HeroController` has `PUT /class`. `UsersRepository.changeClass` (JPQL compare-and-set on `archetype_changed_at`). Policy `hero-class` (10/min per user). Tests: `ClassSwitchTest`, `HeroClassServiceTest`; `HeroApiTest` covers `/hero/class`. HTTP surface: `PUT /api/user/hero/class`. No new bugs (still B1–B37).
3. **`it/`** (your lane, in this PR as you offered):
   - New `it/HeroClassIT` (the JPQL compare-and-set, the event's JSONB with a `null` `chosen`, a lost CAS writing no event, the service end to end), id block **9_000_5xx** (`ApiContractIT` took 4xx), added to the list in `IntegrationTest`'s javadoc.
   - `ApiContractIT`, as you asked: `playStory` ends with `PUT /hero/class` (a qualified class other than the top one, or a pin), whose 200 must fit `hero.json` like `GET /hero`; the story now expects `CLASS_CHANGED`; `checkDetails` checks `from`/`to` against `ARCHETYPES` and `chosen` as nullable. Two new tests: `classErrorsAreProblems` (409, then 200 + 429 with `Retry-After`, problem shapes; unknown class → 400) and `classBeforeTheFirstSyncIs404` (ids 4xx + 7, 8).
4. `PROGRESS.md`: I ticked Phase 11's "Class switch" done-when and appended "As built (B6)" under Phase 11.
Reply (integration, `int/i4-wiring`): 1 is in `contract.md` (`PUT /hero/class`: the order of checks, the race no-op, the `detail` texts). 2 is in the `AGENTS.md` index. 3: thanks, `HeroClassIT` and the `ApiContractIT` additions verified (31 ITs green, also run from the integration worktree on `ea11a54`). 4: kept; your agent file allows notes under your phase.

I4 (`int/i4-wiring`) wires `/api/*` to the backend (`web/next.config.ts`: a rewrite to `BACKEND_URL`, 120 s proxy timeout). One piece is feature code in your lane: **send the browser's zone after login** (contract, "GET/PUT /preferences", "Browser zone on login"):
- After the `#token` hand-off (`app/dashboard/token-handoff.tsx`, or the first Home load after it), read `GET /preferences`. If the stored `timezone` is `"UTC"` (the default, never set) and `browserTimeZone()` resolves to a different zone (`sameTimeZone`, `lib/preferences.ts`), send one `PUT /preferences` with the full object and only `timezone` changed. Then invalidate `hero` (its dates and `day_ends_at` change).
- Never overwrite a zone that isn't `UTC` (the user picked it in Settings). Ignore a failed PUT. Don't block the redirect to `/home` on it.
- Also from B6 (#30): the order is no-op → 409 → 429 → change, so flip the mock's cooldown and qualification checks. #30 is merged, so also remove `PUT /api/user/hero/class` from `PENDING_ENDPOINTS`.

# Handoff board

The shared message board for the backend, UI and integration agents. Read it at the start of every session. Append new entries at the bottom and don't edit other agents' entries; the owner replies underneath and sets the status. Format and rules: `docs/agents/WORKFLOW.md`.

The kit is committed in I0. Start with your first step from `docs/agents/WORKFLOW.md`. Stop after each PR for review.

B1 (PR `backend/b1-activity`): `V4__activity.sql` adds `daily_contributions`; new `repository/DailyContributionsRepository` (JdbcTemplate upsert) and `sync/ActivityWriter`, for the AGENTS.md index. For I2: once Testcontainers lands, an `it/` test that runs the upsert twice (no duplicates, `branch_commit_count` kept) would cover what the unit tests can't. Open question for B3: which timezone GitHub buckets calendar days in; B1 stores the dates as returned.

# Three-agent workflow

Three Claude Code agents work in parallel on `tushar27x/insightsHubV2`, each in its own git worktree and branch. The developer (Tushar) reviews and merges every PR. **Agents never merge, never push to `main`, and never force-push.**

| Agent | Definition | Owns (may edit) | Must not edit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **backend** | `.claude/agents/backend-engineer.md` | `src/main/**`, `src/test/**` (except `src/test/**/it/**`), `src/main/resources/db/migration/**`, `application.yml`, `pom.xml` main dependencies, `BUGS.md` entries for its bugs | `web/**`, `docs/api/**`, `e2e/**`, `.github/**` |
| **ui** | `.claude/agents/ui-engineer.md` | `web/**` except `web/lib/api/types.ts` and `web/public/fixtures/**` | Anything outside `web/`, plus the two paths above |
| **integration** | `.claude/agents/integration-qa.md` | `docs/**` (plan, contract, fixtures, agents), `PROGRESS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `web/lib/api/types.ts`, `web/public/fixtures/**`, `e2e/**`, `.github/workflows/**`, `src/test/**/it/**`, `pom.xml` **test** dependencies (Testcontainers etc.) | Feature code in `src/main/**` or `web/app/**`, `web/components/**` (it files bugs instead) |

**Shared files:** `pom.xml` and `application.yml` are the usual conflict spots. Whoever needs a change outside their lane writes a request in `docs/agents/HANDOFF.md`, and the owner makes it.

## Sources of truth

1. `docs/v2-hero-plan.md`: the product, rules, backend and UI spec. It wins over `PROGRESS.md` and `AGENTS.md` until the docs step updates those.
2. `docs/api/contract.md` + `docs/api/fixtures/`: the API shapes. **Only the integration agent edits them.** Backend responses and UI types must match them.
3. `docs/design/` (PNGs, `tokens.json`, `sprites.json`): the look.
4. `AGENTS.md`: repo conventions (no AI attribution in commits or PRs, log bugs in `BUGS.md`, no token-shaped literals in tests, DTOs only from controllers, no secrets in logs).

## Worktrees and branches

Run once, from the main checkout:

```bash
git fetch origin && git switch main && git pull
git worktree add ../ih-backend     -b backend/b1-activity
git worktree add ../ih-ui          -b ui/u1-scaffold
git worktree add ../ih-integration -b int/i0-docs
```

- Branch names: `backend/bN-…`, `ui/uN-…`, `int/iN-…`.
- **One PR per step.** Start each new step from fresh `main`: `git switch main && git pull && git switch -c <next>`.
- Rebase on `main` before opening a PR. Never merge `main` into a branch.
- A PR description has: what changed, how it was tested, the plan step, bugs found (B-numbers), and contract changes (if any). No AI attribution lines.
- Each agent stops after opening its PR (or after pushing its branch, if `gh` isn't set up) and waits for the developer.

## Order and dependencies

```
I0 docs (merge FIRST: commits the kit, updates PROGRESS/AGENTS)
 ├── Backend: B1 → B2 → B3 → B4 → B5 → B6 → B7 → B8
 ├── UI:      U1 → U2 → U3 → U4 → U5 → U6        (on fixtures; never blocked by the backend)
 └── Integration: I1 → I2 → I3 → I4 → I5 → I6    (follows both, wires them together)
```

| Step | Agent | Content | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| I0 | integration | Commit `docs/**` and `.claude/agents/**` from this kit. Update `PROGRESS.md` (Part D: hero-pet plan, the decisions table, Phase 11 → "Hero engine", `habit_alerts` → `hero_events`, the 3-agent working agreement, frontend now in scope) and `AGENTS.md` (remove "No frontend", add the `web/` and `docs/` layout, the agent lanes, the new next steps) | — |
| B1 | backend | `V4__activity.sql` + the sync writes `daily_contributions.calendar_count` (plan §3, Phase 10, first bullet) | I0 |
| B2 | backend | Phase 9: `ProblemDetail` everywhere (shape in contract.md), validation, logging, no secrets in logs | B1 |
| B3 | backend | Scheduled daily sync + **branch scan** (`branch-activity.graphql`, `countBranchCommits`). Check whether `history()` filters on author or committer date, and how GitHub buckets calendar days by timezone, and record both in `PROGRESS.md` | B2 |
| B4 | backend | `V5__hero.sql` + `HeroRules` (pure, tests first, every rule and edge case) | B3 |
| B5 | backend | Hourly hero job + `GET /hero`, `GET /hero/events`, `GET/PUT /preferences` + the `#token` fragment redirect | B4 |
| B6 | backend | `PUT /hero/class` (qualify ≥ 40 or top class, 7-day cooldown) | B5 |
| B7 | backend | Phase 12 digest from `hero_events` (`NotificationChannel`, email, AI intro with fallback, signed unsubscribe) | B6 |
| B8 | backend | Phase 13 Arena: leaderboard + my rank | B7, contract update from integration |
| U1 | ui | Scaffold `web/` (Next 16, TS, Tailwind 4, TanStack Query): tokens from `tokens.json`, fonts, `PixelSprite` + `sprites.json`, `lib/api.ts`, `lib/auth.ts`, `lib/queries.ts`, mock mode reading `web/public/fixtures/` (U1 creates that folder as a plain copy of `docs/api/fixtures/`; integration owns it from then on) | I0 |
| U2 | ui | Title `/`, `/dashboard` (reads `#token`), tab layout (bottom bar on phone, top nav on desktop), all system states | U1 |
| U3 | ui | Home: tier backdrops, hero + mood overlays, hearts, XP, today card + countdown, week strip, events | U2 |
| U4 | ui | Journal + Hero sheet | U3 |
| U5 | ui | Change class + Settings (rest-day picker at most 2, timezone, toggles) | U4 |
| U6 | ui | Arena "under construction" shell, then the real board after B8 | U5 |
| I1 | integration | Write `web/lib/api/types.ts` from the contract (the UI then imports from it). Add a test that fails if `web/public/fixtures/` drifts from `docs/api/fixtures/`, and a web test that validates every fixture against the types | U1 |
| I2 | integration | **Testcontainers** (Postgres + Redis, `@ServiceConnection`) so `./mvnw verify` never touches Neon (fixes B23). Fix `contextLoads`. Add a GitHub Actions CI workflow: backend `./mvnw verify`, web lint + build + tests | B1 |
| I3 | integration | Backend contract tests: MockMvc responses for `/insights`, `/hero`, `/hero/events`, `/preferences` match the fixture shapes (keys, types, enums) | B5 |
| I4 | integration | Wiring: Next `rewrites`, the login link, the `#token` hand-off, the proxy-timeout check for `/sync` (worst case about 90 s). Add direct CORS for `/sync` only if needed | B5, U2 |
| I5 | integration | Playwright e2e: (a) the mock-mode suite for every screen, mood and error state; (b) a local full-stack smoke test with GitHub and the LLM stubbed (WireMock or a test profile), JWT minted by the test | I3, I4, U5 |
| I6 | integration | Responsive and accessibility pass (320/375/768/1280 px, reduced motion, labels), screenshots compared with `docs/design/png/`, a release checklist | U6 |

## `docs/agents/HANDOFF.md` (the shared message board)

Each agent reads it at the start of a session and appends entries, never rewriting other agents' entries:

```
## 2026-10-17 · backend → integration · REQUEST
Contract: GET /hero should also return `last_life_lost_on` (needed for …). Proposed type: date|null.
Status: open
```

Types: `REQUEST` (needs another lane to act), `FYI` (a merged change others should know about), `BLOCKED` (waiting on a request). The owner replies under the entry and sets `Status: done`.

## Guardrails (all agents)

- ⚠️ **B23:** until I2 lands, the full backend test suite runs Flyway against the **live Neon DB**. Run targeted unit tests only: `./mvnw test -Dtest=HeroRulesTest`. Never start the app or the full suite against Neon without the developer's OK.
- Never commit `.env` or anything secret-shaped. Never log tokens.
- GitHub data comes from GraphQL. REST only for OAuth and `/user/emails`. No `repo` scope.
- The archetype is scored by code. The LLM only adds flavour text, and every AI output has a static fallback.
- Don't touch v1 (`public` schema, the `insight_hub` repo).
- When the plan is ambiguous, write the question in `HANDOFF.md` and carry on with the most reasonable reading. Say which reading you took in the PR.

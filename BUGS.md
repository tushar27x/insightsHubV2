# Bug Log

Every bug hit while building Insight Hub v2: what we saw, why it happened, how it was fixed, and what to remember.
New bugs get the next `B` number. PR descriptions list the bugs found while building that phase.

---

### B1
**Spring AI 1.0.0 doesn't support Spring Boot 4** · Phase 0 · Dependency
- **Symptom:** caught during planning, before it could break anything. Spring AI 1.0.x targets Boot 3 (Spring Framework 6, Jackson 2); the project uses Boot 4 (Framework 7, Jackson 3).
- **Fix:** `spring-ai.version` → `2.0.0`.
- **Lesson:** after a major Boot upgrade, check every Spring-ecosystem library's supported Boot line first.

### B2
**Properties bound to `spring.insightshub` instead of `insightshub`** · Phase 0 · Config
- **Symptom:** `@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "insightshub")` received nothing.
- **Root cause:** in `application.yml`, the `insightshub:` block was indented under `spring:`.
- **Fix:** made `insightshub:` a top-level key.
- **Lesson:** YAML nesting *is* the property name. Spring ignores keys it doesn't recognize, so check indentation first.

### B3
**`InsightsHubProperties` couldn't bind** · Phase 0 · Code
- **Root cause:** a plain class with package-private fields and no setters or constructor, so Spring had no way to set the values.
- **Fix:** turned it into a `record` (constructor binding).
- **Lesson:** records are the simplest immutable way to bind configuration.

### B4
**`.env` not loaded: DB login as the literal user `${DB_USER}`** · Phase 0 · Dependency
- **Symptom:** `password authentication failed for user '${DB_USER}'`, shown at the bottom as `Unable to determine Dialect without JDBC metadata`.
- **Root cause:** `spring-dotenv` 4.0.0 (2023) was built against Boot 3. Boot 4 moved `ConfigurableBootstrapContext` to `org.springframework.boot.bootstrap`, so the library's listener method no longer overrode anything and never ran. No error was raised.
- **Fix:** removed the library; `spring.config.import: "optional:file:.env[.properties]"`.
- **Lesson:** the real cause is at the first `WARN`/`Caused by`, not the last stack trace. Prefer built-in features over small libraries across major upgrades.

### B5
**`.env` not git-ignored** · Phase 0 · Security
- **Symptom:** found in review before `git init`.
- **Fix:** rewrote `.gitignore` with secrets first (`.env`, `.env.*`, keys, local profiles); verified `.env` was never committed.
- **Lesson:** set up `.gitignore` before the first `git add .`, especially for a public repo.

### B6
**`OpenAiAudioSpeechAutoConfiguration`: "At least one credential source must be specified"** · Phase 0 · Config
- **Root cause:** the OpenAI starter auto-configures chat, embedding, image, audio speech, transcription and moderation models, each needing a key. None was configured.
- **Fix:** Groq API key + base URL for chat; `spring.ai.model.{audio.speech,audio.transcription,image,moderation,embedding}: none`. (First fixed with `spring.autoconfigure.exclude`, then switched to these properties, which survive class renames.)
- **Lesson:** a starter switches features on; properties or excludes switch them off.

### B7
**pgvector: "required a bean of type `EmbeddingModel` that could not be found"** · Phase 0 · Config
- **Root cause:** `vectorstore: type: none` was nested under `spring.ai.model`, so the real key `spring.ai.vectorstore.type` was never set. With embeddings disabled, pgvector still loaded and had no embedding model.
- **Fix:** moved it to `spring.ai.vectorstore.type: none`.
- **Lesson:** same as B2: an unknown key is ignored silently, and the symptom shows up somewhere else.

### B8
**Groq base URL wrong** · Phase 0 · Config
- **Symptom:** no error at startup (no API call is made); found by probing the endpoints.
- **Root cause:** Spring AI 2.0's default base URL includes `/v1` (`https://api.openai.com/v1`). `https://api.groq.com/openai` and `https://api.groq.com/v1/openai` both return 404.
- **Fix:** `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` (returns 401 without a key, i.e. the endpoint exists).
- **Lesson:** "the app starts" doesn't mean an external integration works.

### B9
**`Cannot parse port number: https://<host>.upstash.io"`** · Phase 1 · Config
- **Symptom:** the first request using Redis returned 500.
- **Root cause:** `REDIS_HOST` held Upstash's REST URL (`https://...`) plus a stray `"`. Lettuce speaks the Redis protocol and needs a bare hostname.
- **Fix:** bare hostname in `.env`; port 6379 and TLS stay in `application.yml`.
- **Lesson:** Redis connects **lazily** (first command); Postgres connects **eagerly** at startup. The bad value had been there since Phase 0.

### B10
**`wrong column type ... [github_id]; found [int8], but expecting [numeric(38,0)]`** · Phase 2 · Code
- **Root cause:** `BigInteger` maps to SQL `NUMERIC`.
- **Fix:** `Long` for `BIGINT`.
- **Lesson:** `ddl-auto: validate` catches type mismatches at startup, so keep it on.

### B11
**Entity construction and defaults** · Phase 2 · Code (found in review)
- **Problems:** `@AllArgsConstructor` removed the no-arg constructor JPA needs; `Boolean` fields defaulted to `null` against `NOT NULL` columns; same for `Insights.stats` and `updatedAt`.
- **Root cause:** a DB `DEFAULT` only applies when the INSERT *leaves the column out*. Hibernate sends every column, so `null` is sent.
- **Fix:** protected no-arg constructor + public constructor for the required fields; primitive flags with Java defaults; `stats = new HashMap<>()`; `@UpdateTimestamp`.

### B12
**`public void User(Long, String)` isn't a constructor** · Phase 2 · Code
- **Root cause:** it has a return type, and the class is named `Users`. Java allows methods named like a class, so it compiled silently.
- **Fix:** `public Users(Long githubId, String login)`.

### B13
**`No property 'existsUser' found for type 'Users'`** · Phase 2 · Code
- **Root cause:** Spring Data derived queries must follow `existsBy<Property>`; anything else is parsed as a property name.
- **Fix:** removed it; `existsById` and `findById` are inherited from `JpaRepository`.
- **Lesson:** repository methods are validated at startup, after the entity schema check.

### B14
**Never-synced users would be skipped by the sync query** · Phase 2 · Logic (found in review)
- **Root cause:** `findByNeedsReauthFalseAndLastSyncedAtBefore`: `NULL < cutoff` isn't true in SQL. Adding `Or...IsNull` binds wrongly, because `OR` has lower precedence than `AND`.
- **Fix:** `@Query`: `needsReauth = false and (lastSyncedAt is null or lastSyncedAt < :cutoff)`.
- **Lesson:** derived method names can't express brackets.

### B15
**IntelliJ: `Cannot resolve symbol 'log'` / `getGithubId`, while `./mvnw compile` passed** · Phase 2 · Tooling
- **Root cause:** Arch's `intellij-idea-community-edition` (IC-262.10315.125) doesn't bundle the Lombok plugin. Annotation processing settings were already correct.
- **Fix:** installed JetBrains' Lombok plugin 262.8665.176 (compatible with `262.*`) into the IDE's user plugin folder.
- **Lesson:** IDE errors + green Maven build = IDE setup problem. An IntelliJ update may require reinstalling the plugin from the Marketplace.

### B16
**`createdAt=null` right after `save()`** · Phase 2 · Code
- **Root cause:** the DB sets it (`DEFAULT now()`), but Hibernate doesn't read back columns it didn't write (`insertable = false`).
- **Fix:** `@Generated(event = EventType.INSERT)`.

### B17
**`LazyInitializationException: Could not initialize proxy [Users#...] - no session`** · Phase 2 · Code
- **Root cause:** `findById` runs in its own transaction; `Insights.user` is a LAZY proxy, and the session was closed when `getLogin()` tried to load it.
- **Fix:** `@EntityGraph(attributePaths = "user")` on `InsightsRepository.findById`. Also set `spring.jpa.open-in-view: false`, so web requests behave the same instead of hiding this.
- **Lesson:** load what you need inside the transaction (fetch graph / fetch join / service `@Transactional`).

### B18
**Re-running `save(new ...)` on existing rows** · Phase 2 · Code
- **Symptoms:** `Users`: no error, but `merge` copied the new object's default preferences over the stored row (a silent overwrite). `Insights`: `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "insights_pkey"`.
- **Root cause:** Spring Data's `save()` decides "new" by the id. `Users` had its id set → `merge`; `Insights` had a null id until `@MapsId` filled it → `persist` → INSERT.
- **Fix:** find-or-create (`findById(id).orElseGet(...)`), then modify and save.
- **Lesson:** for existing rows, always load and then update. Never `save(new Entity(existingId))`.

### B19
**`RestClient.Builder` auto-config only present through the Spring AI starter** · Phase 3 · Dependency (latent, no failure yet)
- **Found by:** `./mvnw dependency:tree` while building the GitHub client. `spring-boot-restclient` (which auto-configures `RestClient.Builder` in Boot 4) came in only via `spring-ai-starter-model-openai → spring-boot-starter-restclient`.
- **Risk:** removing or changing the AI starter would make startup fail with "no bean of type `RestClient.Builder`" in code unrelated to AI.
- **Fix:** declared `spring-boot-starter-restclient` directly in `pom.xml`.
- **Lesson:** Boot 4 splits auto-config into modules. Declare a starter for every feature you use directly; don't rely on transitive ones.

### B20
**v1: `calculate_user_insights` crashes on any empty repository** · Phase 4 · Logic (bug in v1, found while porting)
- **Symptom:** running v1's real Python code on the Phase 3 fixture: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` at `repo.get("defaultBranchRef", {}).get("target", {})`.
- **Root cause:** GitHub returns `"defaultBranchRef": null` for a repo with no commits. Python's `dict.get(key, default)` only uses the default when the key is *missing*, not when its value is `null`.
- **Impact in v1 production:** `routes.py` swallows the exception in its broad `try/except`, so any user with an empty repo among their top 5 by stars logs in fine but **never gets insights saved**, silently.
- **Fix (v2):** `InsightsEngine` treats every nested GitHub object as nullable; covered by `InsightsEngineTest.emptyRepositoryDoesNotCrash_B20`. v1 itself is unchanged.
- **Lesson:** `x.get(k, {})` is not null-safe in Python, and a blanket `except` turns crashes into silent data loss.

### B21
**Phase 4 branch created from a stale `main`** · Phase 4 · Process
- **Symptom:** the Phase 3 test fixture was missing on the new branch.
- **Root cause:** local `main` was 4 commits behind `origin/main` (the PR #2 merge wasn't pulled), and the branch was created from the Phase 3 branch tip instead of the merge. The checkout had also changed between commands (likely IDE git activity during the merge).
- **Fix:** fast-forwarded `main` (`git merge --ff-only origin/main`) and recreated the branch from `origin/main` before any commits.
- **Lesson:** before branching, verify `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` and `git status -sb` show `main` level with `origin/main`.

### B22
**`reference to assertThat is ambiguous`** · Phase 4 · Test code
- **Root cause:** `JsonMapper.valueToTree(...)` returns a generic `<T extends JsonNode> T`. Passed straight to AssertJ's overloaded `assertThat`, the compiler can't infer `T` (both `Predicate` and `IntPredicate` overloads match).
- **Fix:** assign the result to a `JsonNode` variable first.

### B23
**`./mvnw test` would apply unreviewed Flyway migrations to the live Neon DB** · Phase 4 · Process (latent, caught before it happened)
- **Found by:** about to run the full suite after adding `V2__archetype_classes.sql`. `InsightshubApplicationTests.contextLoads()` is a `@SpringBootTest` that starts the whole app with the real datasource, so Flyway would migrate Neon as a side effect of running the tests.
- **Risk:** a migration applied before review can't be changed afterwards. Flyway checksums applied migrations and refuses to start when a file differs, which forces a `flyway repair` or a fix-up migration.
- **Workaround (this PR):** ran the unit tests with `-Dtest='!InsightshubApplicationTests'`, and dry-ran V2 on Neon inside `BEGIN … ROLLBACK` (Postgres DDL is transactional), so nothing was committed. A local Docker Postgres wasn't usable (no permission on `/var/run/docker.sock`).
- **Proper fix (Phase 14):** Testcontainers + `@ServiceConnection`, so tests never touch Neon. Until then, exclude `contextLoads` when a PR adds a migration.
- **Fixed in I2:** `contextLoads` became `it/ApplicationContextIT` on Testcontainers Postgres + Redis (`./mvnw verify`, Docker needed). Surefire and Failsafe also point `spring.datasource.url` and the Redis host at unresolvable `*.invalid` hosts, so a test that boots the app without the containers fails to connect instead of reaching Neon. `./mvnw test` is unit-only and safe to run in full.
- **Lesson:** a "does the context load?" test against a shared database isn't harmless: it runs every startup side effect, migrations included.

### B24
**Renaming enum constants broke `DevDataRunner`** · Phase 4 · Code
- **Symptom:** `cannot find symbol: variable CODE_CRUSADER` in `dev/DevDataRunner.java` after replacing the archetypes.
- **Root cause:** the dev runner hard-codes an archetype, and only the `insights` package had been searched for usages.
- **Fix:** use `Archetype.PALADIN`, the same mapping as the V2 migration (`CODE_CRUSADER → PALADIN`).
- **Lesson:** after renaming or removing an enum constant, grep the whole source tree, including `dev`/profile-only code that normal tests don't exercise.

### B25
**`NoClassDefFoundError: com/tushar27x/insightshub/ai/AiConfig`** · Phase 5 · Tooling
- **Symptom:** live tests failed before any HTTP call, for a class that compiled fine. `target/classes/.../AiConfig.class` existed right afterwards.
- **Root cause:** IntelliJ was open and rebuilt the just-edited `AiConfig.java` into the same `target/classes` while Maven's test JVM was running. Timestamps: test report `13:22:10.706`, class file rewritten `13:22:10.989`. The file was briefly missing.
- **Fix:** rerun. Nothing in the code.
- **Happened again** with resources during the persona change: `FileNotFoundException: prompts/weekly-review.st` for a file that was in `src/` and showed up in `target/classes` right after the run (IntelliJ copied it at `14:26:11`). Rerunning fixed it.
- **Lesson:** an IDE and Maven sharing `target/` can race. If a "class not found" makes no sense, compare timestamps before debugging code. (Optional: in IntelliJ, delegate build/run to Maven, or turn off "Build project automatically".)

### B26
**Groq retired v1's models: `404: The model 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile' does not exist or you do not have access to it`** · Phase 5 · Dependency (external)
- **Found by:** the first live run of `AiLiveTest`. The key was valid (a fake key gets `401`, the real one got `404` for the model).
- **Root cause:** `GET /openai/v1/models` for the key lists no Llama 3.x chat models any more: only `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `openai/gpt-oss-20b`, `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` and a few non-chat models.
- **Impact on v1 production:** v1 hard-codes both model names, and its `except` blocks fall back to Gemini, then to static text. Unless its Gemini fallback works, **v1 users currently get "Your code is so average it didn't even trigger my fallback circuits"** instead of real reviews, with no error visible.
- **Fix (v2):** `spring.ai.openai.chat.options.model: openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `insightshub.ai.fast-model: openai/gpt-oss-20b`. Model names live in config, not code.
- **Lesson:** hosted model names are not stable. Keep them in config, and have a live smoke test (and, later, an alert) for "every answer is a fallback".

### B27
**Reasoning model returned empty content (`finish_reason: length`)** · Phase 5 · Config
- **Symptom:** a direct call to `openai/gpt-oss-20b` with v1's 200-token cap used 198 tokens on hidden reasoning and returned `""`. The chain treats blank as a failure, so every repo summary would have silently become the default text.
- **Root cause:** reasoning tokens count against `max_tokens`. v1's caps (100–300) were sized for non-reasoning Llama.
- **Fix:** per-provider `reasoning_effort: low` (`insightshub.ai.reasoning-effort`), and `LlmChain.REASONING_HEADROOM` (+300 tokens) when an effort is set. It's per provider because non-reasoning fallback models may reject the parameter.
- **Lesson:** when switching to a reasoning model, retune token limits; "answer length" and "token budget" are no longer the same thing.

### B28
**The LLM assumed a user's gender** · Phase 5 · Prompt
- **Symptom:** live character-sheet lore for `octocat`: "He shows up every workday...".
- **Root cause:** v1's persona said nothing about how to refer to the developer, and these texts describe real users.
- **Fix:** persona line: address the developer as "you" or by login; use "they" if a pronoun is needed. The rerun said "They've been glued to the terminal...".
- **Lesson:** review generated text about real people for assumptions, not only for format.

### B29
**`No qualifying bean of type 'InsightsHubProperties'` in `AuthApiTest`** · Phase 6 · Test code
- **Symptom:** all 12 `@WebMvcTest` tests failed to load the context. Adding `@EnableConfigurationProperties` to the test class changed nothing.
- **Root cause:** a slice test only registers the slice's beans; the main class's `@ConfigurationPropertiesScan` doesn't apply. And annotations on the test class itself are not read as configuration, so `@EnableConfigurationProperties` there is ignored.
- **Fix:** a nested `@TestConfiguration` carrying `@EnableConfigurationProperties({InsightsHubProperties.class, AuthProperties.class})`, added to `@Import`.
- **Lesson:** in slice tests, put configuration on a `@TestConfiguration` class, never on the test class.

### B30
**v1 logs every user's GitHub access token** · Phase 6 · Security (v1)
- **Found by:** porting v1's callback (`app/api/routes.py`, line 102): `print("GitHub token response:", token_data)`. `token_data` is GitHub's token response, including `access_token` (scope `repo`: read/write to private repos).
- **Impact on v1 production:** every login writes a live token to the host's logs, readable by anyone with log access.
- **Fix (v2):** tokens never appear in logs or exception messages. The token exchange error carries only GitHub's `error` code (e.g. `bad_verification_code`). Tests assert the token isn't in error messages or the JWT.
- **Fix (v1, suggested):** delete the `print` line, and treat the logged tokens as leaked: users can revoke at github.com/settings/applications, or the OAuth App's tokens can be reset in its settings.
- **Lesson:** never log whole responses from auth endpoints; log the fields you need.

### B31
**GitGuardian: "Generic Encryption Key" in `SecurityTestData.java`** · Phase 6 · Process
- **Symptom:** the GitGuardian check failed on PR #6 with 2 incidents.
- **Root cause:** the test keys were 44-character Base64 literals in fields named `*_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. They were made up (one decodes to the bytes 0–31), and no `.env` value appears anywhere in the PR (checked value by value), but a scanner can't tell a fake key from a real one.
- **Fix:** test keys are built at runtime from byte sequences; `AuthApiTest` gets its key through `@DynamicPropertySource`. Folded into the feat commit and force-pushed, so the literals never appear in the branch history. The two existing incidents still need resolving as test credentials in the GitGuardian dashboard.
- **Lesson:** never write key-shaped literals, even fake ones; generate test keys in code. When a scanner fires, first check whether any real value leaked before rewriting anything.

### B32
**`RedisCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer` not found** · Phase 7 · Dependency
- **Symptom:** the class Boot 3 docs point to (`org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.cache`) wasn't in any jar on the classpath, although Redis and Spring's `@Cacheable` were.
- **Root cause:** Boot 4 split auto-configuration into modules. Cache auto-configuration (including the Redis cache manager) now lives in `spring-boot-cache`, brought in by `spring-boot-starter-cache`, under `org.springframework.boot.cache.autoconfigure`. `spring-boot-starter-data-redis` alone no longer gives you a `CacheManager`.
- **Fix:** add `spring-boot-starter-cache`, plus `spring.cache.type: redis` so a missing Redis cache fails at startup instead of silently falling back to an in-memory cache.
- **Lesson:** on Boot 4, when a Boot 3 class is missing, look for a `spring-boot-<feature>` module and its starter (same story as B19).

### B33
**Removing an "unused" test dependency broke every `@WebMvcTest`** · Phase 7 · Dependency
- **Symptom:** after removing `spring-boot-starter-security-test` (no class in `src/` imported it), all 17 `AuthApiTest` tests failed: `No qualifying bean of type 'HttpSecurity'` while creating `SecurityConfig.apiSecurity`.
- **Root cause:** the module is used without being imported. Its `META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.webmvc.test.autoconfigure.WebMvcTest.includes` and `...AutoConfigureMockMvc.imports` files add Spring Security's auto-configuration (`SecurityAutoConfiguration`, `ServletWebSecurityAutoConfiguration`, ...) to `@WebMvcTest` slices. Without them, the slice has no Spring Security, so no `HttpSecurity` builder.
- **Fix:** kept the dependency, with a pom comment saying why.
- **Lesson:** "no imports" doesn't mean "unused" for Spring Boot starters; they often contribute auto-configuration through `META-INF/spring/*.imports` files. Run the tests before removing a dependency. Same Boot 4 module split as B19 and B32.

### B34
**Spring 7 `ProblemDetail` has no `type` by default** · Phase 9 · Dependency
- **Symptom:** the first `ApiExceptionHandlerTest` run failed 8 of 8 on `No value at JSON path "$.type"`, and `ProblemDetails.write` threw a `NullPointerException` on `getType().toString()`.
- **Root cause:** in Spring Framework 7, `ProblemDetail.forStatus(...)` leaves `type` null, and the JSON leaves it out. RFC 9457 reads a missing `type` as `about:blank`, so this is valid, but `docs/api/contract.md` lists `type` in every error body. (Spring 6 filled in `about:blank`.)
- **Fix:** `ProblemDetails.complete` sets `type: about:blank` and `instance` whenever they're missing. Every error path goes through it: the controller advice, the `/error` controller, the 401/403 writers and the rate-limit interceptor.
- **Lesson:** test the exact JSON shape of an error, not just the status code. Defaults like this changed between Spring 6 and 7 without any compile error.

### B35
**Validation errors named Java fields, not the API's keys** · Phase 9 · Code
- **Symptom:** a test body with an invalid `restDays` came back as `errors[].field = "restDays"`, while every key in the API is snake_case (`rest_days`).
- **Root cause:** Bean Validation reports the Java property path. The DTOs map to snake_case through `@JsonNaming`, which validation doesn't know about.
- **Fix:** `ApiExceptionHandler` converts each field path to snake_case (`week[0].restDays` → `week[0].rest_days`). Found before any endpoint had a request body; B5's `PUT /preferences` is the first one.
- **Lesson:** error payloads have to use the same names as the request the client sent.

### B36
**`daily_contributions` SQL is unqualified and resolves outside `v2`, so every sync fails at the activity write** · Phase 2.6 (B1) · Code · found by integration in I2, fixed in #16
- **Symptom:** `DailyContributionsRepositoryIT` against a real Postgres 17: `ERROR: relation "daily_contributions" does not exist` on both the upsert and `latestDate`. `SyncService.sync` calls `ActivityWriter.writeCalendar` without a catch, so a sync throws there: `POST /api/user/sync` → 500, and the login sync fails (logged, login still succeeds).
- **Root cause:** `DailyContributionsRepository` uses plain JDBC with unqualified table names. Only JPA has `hibernate.default_schema: v2`, Flyway sets the schema only while migrating, and neither the JDBC URL nor the pool sets `search_path`. A connection's default `search_path` is `"$user", public`, and the table lives in `v2`. Not checked against Neon (the integration lane doesn't connect to it), but nothing in the config would make it different there.
- **Why the unit tests missed it:** `DailyContributionsRepositoryTest` and `ActivityWriterTest` mock `JdbcTemplate` and the repository, so no SQL ever ran.
- **Fix (backend):** qualify the SQL (`v2.daily_contributions`), or set the schema for every pooled connection (`spring.datasource.hikari.connection-init-sql` or the `schema` property). A `currentSchema` parameter in the JDBC URL would fix Neon but not the tests, because `@ServiceConnection` supplies its own URL. Then remove `@Disabled("B36 …")` from `it/DailyContributionsRepositoryIT`.
- **Fixed in #16:** the repository qualifies the table with the Flyway schema (`spring.flyway.default-schema`, checked to be a plain identifier), so plain JDBC finds `v2.daily_contributions`. Chosen over `search_path`: Neon's pooler (PgBouncer, transaction mode) doesn't reliably keep session settings. `@Disabled` removed from `it/DailyContributionsRepositoryIT` in the follow-up.
- **Lesson:** SQL that bypasses JPA needs a test against a real database. Mocked `JdbcTemplate` tests check what you send, not whether Postgres accepts it.
